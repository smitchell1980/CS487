For this portion of the project we decided to code the data generation in python.  Python has built-in libraries that allow for easy output of data into a csv file format.  Python also is fairly portable and can be run on many systems to allow data to be generated on many systems without modification.

Ian created the initial data generation code.  Based off the table two scheme in the paper "The Wisonsin Benchmark: Past, Present, and Future", he generated code that created the first 13 attributes for the tuples.  The first is a unique int, unique1, randomly generated between 0 and n-1, where n is the max number of tuples in the table.  The second is another unique int,unique2, generated sequentially from 0 to n-1, again where n is the max number of tuples in the table.  This value is assigned the primary key for the table.  The third attribute is a value between 0 and 1.  This value is generated by taking the mod 2 of unique1.  The fourth attribute is a value between 0 and 3, generated by taking the mod 4 of unique1.  The fifth attribute is a value between 0 and 9, generated by taking the mod 10 of unique1. The sixth attribute is a value between 0 and 19, generated by taking the mod 20 of unique1.  The seventh attribute is a value between 0 and 99, generated by taking the mod 100 of unique1.  The eigth attribute is a value between 0 and 9, generated by taking the mod 10 of unique1.  The ninth attribute is a value between 0 and 4, generated by taking the mod 5 of unique1.  The tenth attribute is a value between 0 and 1, generated by taking the mod 2 of unique1.  The eleventh attribute is the same value as unique1.  The twelfth attribute is a even value between 0 and 198, generated by taking the seventh attribute and multiplying it by 2.  The thirteenth attribute is a odd value between 1 and 199, generated by taking the seventh attribute and multiplying it by 2 and then adding 1. 

Sean created the code to generate the final 3 attributes of the tuple.  The fourteenth and fifteenth attributes are strings, with length of 52.  The first 7 characters are the significant characters.  These strings are also analogies of unique1 and unique2 and can be used as keys just like unique1/2.  To generate these strings the unique value is first mod 26.  This result is then added to the character 'A'.  26 is chosen so that after the addition the result is still a character from 'A'-'Z'.  This value is stored ina  temp array as n-1 index. Then the unique value is divided by 26 and the mod and addition are repeated.  Storing the value in n-2.  This cycle repeats until the unique divided by 26 is = 0.  Once this completed the right justified characters are copied over into the stringu1/2 as left justified.  The final attribute is again a 52 character string.  This string is a cyclic value that rotates through 'AAAA', 'HHHH', 'OOOO', 'VVVV' through all the tuples.

For this project we have decided to use PostgreSQL database hosted by PSU. PostgreSQL was the database used during CS486 so it provides an interface that we are already familiar with.  PostgreSQL is also readily available for MacOSx and Windows.  This will allow us to do comparisons between the same DBMS with different hardware profiles.  This will allow us to possible use the Google Big Query credits for comparisions as well later on.

Learnings discovered through this portion of the project include don't use capital letters in PostgreSQL.  It just creates the hassel of having to encapsulate the attributes with capital letters in quotation marks.  Also learned python has library for PostgreSQL integration.  This has opened up th experimenting with setting up the database with python in just loading the data directly in that way instead of using the PhpPgAdmin to do all the work.
